# UFOs
## Overview
UFO webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but adding in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results
Created four more filters: city, state, country, and shape.

# Summary
You can now filter by date, city, state, country, and shape.  One drawback of the filters is there no way to know what is in the table.  Many filter inputs return nothing.  A drop down menu could be added to each finlter to help the user know what is in the table.  The filter could by dunamic so the dropdown menu will change depending on the filters that have been applied.  It would also be good to be able to filter mulitple items at a time.
