# UFOs
## Overview
The UFO webpage and dynamic table are working as intended but adding in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to filtering the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape as well.


## Results
Created four more filters: city, state, country, and shape.  You my now filter by date, city, state, country, and shape.  Fill out the filter criteria and press enter to see filtered results in the table.

# Summary
You can now filter by date, city, state, country, and shape.  One drawback of the filters is there no way to know what is in the table.  Many filter inputs return nothing.  A drop-down menu could be added to each filter to help the user know what is in the table.  The filter could by dynamic so the dropdown menu will change depending on what other filters have already been applied.  Another filter could be added for the Duration as well.
